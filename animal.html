            Not all animal shelters are the same. Fortunate homeless and unwanted animals end up in the hundreds of
            open-admission animal shelters that are staffed by professional, caring people. <br>

            At these facilities, frightened animals are reassured, sick and injured animals receive treatment or a
            peaceful end to their suffering, and the animals’ living quarters are kept clean and dry. Workers at these
            facilities never turn away needy animals and give careful consideration to each animal’s special emotional
            and physical needs. <br>
            To be able to offer refuge to every animal in need, open-admission shelters must euthanize unadopted and
            unadoptable animals. The alternative—turning them away—is cruel and leaves the animals in grave danger.Many
            less fortunate lost or abandoned animals end up in pitiful shelters that are nothing more than shacks
            without walls or other protection from the elements, where animals are often left to die from exposure,
            disease, or fights with other animals. <br><br>

            

        "We Are Their Voices"undercover investigation at a North Carolina no-kill shelter called All Creatures Great and Small
            documented that animals were suffering physically and emotionally as a result of ongoing, systematic abuse
            and neglect. In addition, the investigator observed that dogs, cats, and other animals were frequently left
            to languish in constant confinement, deprived of veterinary care, and subjected to a multitude of other
            atrocities. <br>

            No shelter that truly cares for animals should ever turn its back on an animal in need, even when that means
            taking in animals who are diseased, badly injured, aggressive, or elderly. These animals have little to no
            chance of being adopted or helped by anyone else, but a responsible animal shelter should at least provide
            them with a painless release from a world that does not want them. <br>

            

            Please do not allow your companion animal to be needlessly euthanized during times of crises. Take the
            appropriate steps now to ensure that he or she is well taken care of even after your divorce or death.
