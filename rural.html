        <p>Sahayog Karo Sanstha has already reached the 21st century, but the same cannot be said of the people living in our
            villages. To get the villagers to the 21st century too, development, education, medical facilities are
            needed. Sahayog Karo Sanstha, is one such pioneer organisation working in various fields in towns and
            villages. We work on different projects in the field of Education, Healthcare, Youth, Environment
            Differently-abled, Women Empowerment and Employment opportunities offered through our organisation with our
            other network partners. We also work to spread awareness about various social issues with the support of our
            volunteers.

            Established as the not- for- profit organization in the year 2009, Sahayog Karo Sanstha operates with the
            single-minded focus of empowering rural India. Our vision is rural empowerment through best practices,
            modern technology and values.

            Our philosophy states that India lives in her villages and we cannot rise to our true potential as a country
            without a fundamental transformation in the lives of people in rural India. At the Sahayog Karo Sanstha we
            believe that the partnership of rural India with corporate, young urban India, the Government and other
            foundations is the key to create a permanent and irreversible change for good.

            Ever since its inception, the foundation has been working to positively impact unserved and underserved
            communities and contribute towards national and international development goals. The organization works
            closely with all the stakeholders' in order to bring about sustainable changes in the lives of the
            underprivileged and last miles communities. To achieve this, the organization implements scalable,
            sustainable and value-driven initiatives in the thematic areas of food and agriculture, environment and
            natural resource management, eco-tourism, education and literacy, water and sanitation, children, rural
            development and poverty alleviation and women empowerment.
